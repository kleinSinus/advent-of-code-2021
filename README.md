# Advent of Code 2021

The times in the following table are in the timezone of the challenge. When it's 00:00 in that timezone its 06:00 in mine.

The estimates on the first few days are the timestamps from when the input files were saved on my machine.
I have to use the estimates since I didn't think of maintaining stats then and didn't track my starting the challenge properly.
The times for part 2 are exact because I can get that data from the website.

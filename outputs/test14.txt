Result length after step 5: 97
Result length after step 6: 193
Result length after step 7: 385
Result length after step 8: 769
Result length after step 9: 1537
Result length after step 10: 3073

After step 10:
- N occurs 865 times
- B occurs 1749 times
- C occurs 298 times
- H occurs 161 times

Taking the quantity of the most common element (B, 1749)
and subtracting the quantity of the least common element (H, 161)
produces 1749 - 161 = 1588.

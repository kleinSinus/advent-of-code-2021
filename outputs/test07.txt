PART ONE
========

  - Move from 16 to 2: 14
  - Move from 1 to 2: 1
  - Move from 2 to 2: 0
  - Move from 0 to 2: 2
  - Move from 4 to 2: 2
  - Move from 2 to 2: 0
  - Move from 7 to 2: 5
  - Move from 1 to 2: 1
  - Move from 2 to 2: 0
  - Move from 14 to 2: 12

This costs a total of 37 fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome;
more expensive outcomes include aligning at position 1 (41 fuel),
position 3 (39 fuel), or position 10 (71 fuel).

PART TWO
========

Fuel cost = Distance was wrong, best horizontal position in this is actually 5:

  - Move from 16 to 2: 66
  - Move from 1 to 2: 10
  - Move from 2 to 2: 6
  - Move from 0 to 2: 15
  - Move from 4 to 2: 1
  - Move from 2 to 2: 6
  - Move from 7 to 2: 3
  - Move from 1 to 2: 10
  - Move from 2 to 2: 6
  - Move from 14 to 2: 45

This costs a total of 168 fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome;
the old alignment position (2) costs 206 fuel instead.

PART ONE
========

Low Point found at (1, 0), value = 1. 
Low Point found at (2, 2), value = 5. 
Low Point found at (6, 4), value = 5. 
Low Point found at (9, 0), value = 0. 

Calculated risk is therefore 15. 

PART TWO
========

There are 4 basins.
The three largest basins have sizes 14, 9 and 9.
If you multiply together the sizes of the three largest basins, you get 1134.
